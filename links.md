1. [The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Shell Scripting: The Basics](https://www.howtogeek.com/67469/the-beginners-guide-to-shell-scripting-the-basics/)<br>
This page helped me get started on Shell Scripting. I felt left out not being able to participate in solving
the scripting problems posted on our course's forum, that's why I started looking up where to start learning
about scripting.

2. [Shell Scripting Crash Course - Beginner Level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-F3YLd6oMw)<br>
Other than the previous page, this video provided a great intro to scripting.

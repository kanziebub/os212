1. [The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Shell Scripting: The Basics](https://www.howtogeek.com/67469/the-beginners-guide-to-shell-scripting-the-basics/)<br>
This page helped me get started on Shell Scripting. I felt left out not being able to participate in solving
the scripting problems posted on our course's forum, that's why I started looking up where to start learning
about scripting.

2. [Shell Scripting Crash Course - Beginner Level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-F3YLd6oMw)<br>
Other than the previous page, this video provided a great intro to scripting.

3. [Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-cybersecurity)<br>
I find this page helpful because I prefer reading over watching a video as I can set my own pace.
This page also provides information in a way that doesn't bore with an eye-pleasing interface
and interesting illustrations.
